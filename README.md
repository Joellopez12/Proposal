# Proposal
This repository contains an Arduino project using PlatformIO, a LED matrix display, and MD_Parola library. It implements a proposal question display with "yes" or "no" buttons. PlatformIO manages the project with config settings in platformio.ini. This C++, initializes the display, sets intensity, and handles button inputs for reliable response.
